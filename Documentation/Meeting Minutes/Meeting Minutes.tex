\begin{enumerate}
	\item Install Whiley command line tool.
	\item Read research papers about QuickCheck to determine strategies for generating test cases.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discussion Points}

\paragraph{Objective 1:} Take Whiley program and generate test cases from it using the Whiley compiler. 

Assuming each Whiley program has specifications for each function.

To investigate:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learn and understand Whiley
	\item Whiley jar file for the compiler
	\item Whiley web project
	\item Maven, pom.xml for dependencies for the generator
	\item Need to know strategies for generating test cases
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Read some research papers about QuickCheck and other testing tools (DART, ArbitCheck)
	\item Read Whiley Getting Started Guide and started reading language specifications
	\item Got WhileyLabs working on my machine, could not get Whiley working on the command line.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Finish draft project proposal and send to supervisors to get it checked (by 30/3/2018).
	\item Reading more research papers. Suggest reading papers about American Fuzzy Lop.
	\item Begin implementation of project. The first steps are to create a Java project with the necessary hooks to access the Whiley compiler.  And, then to be able to read a compiled Whiley file (*.wyil) to identify functions to test. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion Points}

Whiley can also pass functions as an argument to other functions.
\begin{itemize}
		\item What testing method am I using? Random testing? Property testing?  
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Firstly, use random testing using the properties of the function. Pre-condition to for candidate values and post-condition to check test passed or failed. Then will look at limitations of the testing method and decide whether to expand on the testing method (such as using dynamic symbolic execution).
		\end{itemize}
		\item What types to use in test generation? Primitive, recursive etc
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Primitive types: bool, byte, int, real, null, any, void
			\item Array
			\item Later on: records (closed), union
			\item Even later: Recursive types
			\item Extra (may not be implemented) - references, functionss
		\end{itemize}
		\item Testing functions only or also test methods? Methods have side effects.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Test for functions first then by methods.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Using pre- and post-conditions or property syntax?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Do not need to worry as the interpreter should evaluate the pre- and post-conditions. Properties are only used by the verifier and are specified in the pre- and post-conditions.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Read more research papers. Of particular note is MoreBugs, an extension to QuickCheck which generalises test cases so test cases that discover the same bug do not occur again.
	\item Created base implementation of QuickCheck for Whiley. This does
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generates Int (specific Int) and random Bool
		\item Check candidate values are valid based on the precondition. Note: Does not generate a new test to replace the candidate values that do not pass the precondition.
		\item Validates tests using postcondition
	\end{itemize}
	\item Finished project proposal
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start on writing background survey for preliminary report.
	\item Consider the design of QuickCheck for Whiley. Look into more iteration strategies for generating test values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion Points}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Wanted to know about wyal.util.SmallWorldDomain as it also uses a Generator.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Finds counterexamples for the Whiley Theorem Prover.
			\item Exhaustive iteration through possible values in a small range
		\end{itemize}
	\item Technique for writing a related works section in the report is to write a paragraph summary of each paper and then use those paragraphs as a basis for the section. Should be high level.
	\item Keep the test case generator flexible to allow different testing techniques.
	\item Want to compare random vs exhaustive testing.
	\item Function generation can be difficult. Can be inefficient if functions call other functions. Could just create return values for the functions that conform to the functions post-condition. However, need to consider tradeoff between performance and accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implemented exhaustive test generation for booleans and integers.
		\item Started background survey but have not done much of this.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
Background survey for preliminary report
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Array, record and nominal generation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Nominal types. Look at NameResolver and Flowtype checker. Ignore constraints when generating the tests. Like type synonyms.
	\item Bounded random state space. Selecting n samples, using basic probability across the state space.
	\item Arrays should be limited by its array size. This should be a constant upper limit. Random generation of elements. The arrays takes a generator element.
	\item Records. Print name of the field. Don't know field names of \texttt{...}. This generates n number of fields.
	\item Recursive types. Need to know if the type is recursive. Infinite data type e.g. binary tree. Limit it like an array. Cyclic generators? e.g. type list is \{int data, null | List next \}
	\item Integer range paper - For figuring out ranges to use during generation.
\end{itemize}

\section{April 30th 2018}
\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Array generation. Size of elements are bounded between 0 and 3.
	\item Nominal type generation.
	\item Record generation for closed records only. 
	\item Null generation
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Union generator
	\item Start on integer range analysis
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
 \item ResolutionError occurs when a name of a type cannot be found. To resolve, need to import the correct files used such as the Whiley standard library.
 \item Look at Knuth's Algorithm S for random sampling.
 \item Null type primarily used for recursive types.
 \item When generating union types, need to fairly select values of each type. E.g. for int|bool, select an int then a bool then an int etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{May 7th 2018}
\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completed union generation
	\item Fixed some bugs with nominal invariants not being applied
	\item Completed integer range analysis ONLY for nominal types that wrap an integer. I.e. nat is (int x) where x \textgreater 0.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Run the valid and invalid tests written for testing the Whiley compiler.  To see what your tool does and to check that: valid tests don't produce counter examples, and invalid tests (ideally) do.  Don't expect every invalid test will find a counter example though.
	\item Continue working on integer range analysis
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Whiley does implicit casting. E.g. type nat is (int x) where 'a' \textgreater x will verify. In Whiley, a char is an integer from 0 to 255.
 \item A nominal type can have multiple invariants due to multiple where clauses.
 \item Implies (== \textgreater) is a 
 
 \item Each type could have a range. This means that the Generators for types would mirror the hierarchy for Ranges. An array would have a range for the elements itself and the length of the array. 
 \item Trying to add integer ranges for all elements in an array is difficult. For example, type intArr is (int[] x) where all \{ i in 0...\texttt{|x| |} x[i] \textgreater 0 \} .  Could possibly pattern match on this case?
 
 \item implies (== \textgreater) for x ==\textgreater y is !(x) \texttt{||} (x \&\& y)
 \item iff (\textless== \textgreater) for x \textless== \textgreater y is equality i.e. (x == y) 
\end{itemize}

\section{May 13th 2018}
\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integer range analysis for integers in records and array sizes
	\item Tested QuickCheck on the Whiley Valid and Invalid tests with various statistics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start introduction for preliminary report and a bit of the background survey.
	\item Integer range analysis for nominals
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Whiley properties(predicates in Dafny) are used for verification.
 \item Start writing preliminary report. You can look into expanding the project proposal.
 \begin{itemize}
 	 \item Introduction = The purpose of the project
 	\item Background = Briefly about Whiley? About other test frameworks.
 	\item Technical Discussion = High level. Could make a class diagram of the generators. Start with the basics first and then go into more depth such as the extensions of the tool (integer range analysis).
 	\item Data - What results you have so for
 	\item Request for feedback - Can ask if your method for evaluation is good? Evaluators may want more concrete evidence in the form of statistics.
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{May 21st 2018}
\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Integer range analysis for nominals
	\item Started preliminary report - currently done 5 pages. 1 page introduction, 2 pages of background, 2 pages work completed.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Complete preliminary report
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction - Include what have you done so far? What you are doing? Could consider including objectives.
	\item Background 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Should write about tools similar to QuickCheck. Consider looking into and writing about JCrasher.
		\item Write more about Whiley - relate how specifications can be used in testing. Static verification. Do not write about theorem prover but could specify about counter examples. Assume reader has never heard of and/or used Whiley before. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Future plan
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Evaluation of the tool needs to be done.
		\item Method/function calls within methods/functions are expensive. Therefore, need to optimise the performance of calling these functions/methods - call optimisation. One technique is instead of calling the function/method, is to just generate a return value. Problem if it is a method call as a method could modify a variable without returning it e.g. sorting an array without returning it.
		\item Performance comparision between executing functions/methods normally VS call optimisation approach.
		\item Mutation testing - mutating existing Whiley files. Mutating a file means to change some aspect of the file. Examples: changing operators, change forall to a sum, change if to a while statement, delete statements. This is to be able to check that the mutated file would have a different result than the original file. Where to apply mutation, on the .whiley or the .wyil file? Could do this on the .wyil file but then need to convert back into the .whiley file? 
		\item Could do recursive type generation, would need to limit the size of the value generated.
		\item Don't need to do function generation and open record generation. A possible future extension to the tool.
	\end{enumerate} 
	\item Sent draft of preliminary report to Dave, who has given feedback about it.
\end{itemize}

    \item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
Completed Preliminary Report
\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Byte generator
	\item Use Algorithm S for random test generation
	\item Start looking into how functions/methods can be optimised
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
 \item No meeting for next week. Next meeting on June 11th. Same meeting time during exam period. 
 \item Fix typos, move listing captions below, add frames around code.
 \item Could expand on how generators work in QuickCheck
 \item Randoop more concentrated on constructors. Expand more about feedback-directed test generation. Think about talking how it generates values for parameters.
 \item Say more about random test generation, what was considered?
 \item Better explain generators
 \item Talk about issues encountered during implementation e.g. the difficulty of integer range analysis, recursive types, open records.
 \item Add time taken to run the tests. Why are two different integer ranges used in the tests (to limit number of combinations).
 \item Example test techniques in request for feedback
\end{itemize}

\section{June 11th 2018}
\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Byte generator
	\item Implemented Algorithm S for random test generation. Was not sure if this should be added in as there could be bias in the results due to sampling without replacement.
	\item Bounded recursive type generation - bounded to a depth of 3
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Start optimising function calls. This is by replacing the execution of the function/method with a randomly generated value. If same function is called again with the same arguments, it should ideally return the same value.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithm S - random testing. Would be good to talk about the design and tradeoffs in the final report! Included should be fairness issue, performance cost, how it was implemented. 
	\item For random testing, it might be good to look at \url{http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/%7Edjp/files/GPCE17_preprint.pdf}
	\item Record returned values for functions. Same inputs == same outputs. executeInvoke should be called. 
	Override the interpreter.
	\item How is it affecting the data for function optimisation? Invalid tests - are you finding the bugs?
	\item Ideally by the end of the mid-tri break (in tri2), should finish experiments for evaluation.
	\item Mutation testing should be done before the mid-tri break.
	\item QuickCheck versus verification for finding bugs and performance is interesting.
	\item Future extensions: References and methods
	\item This code does not verify, gets empty type error.
	Due to spaces VS indentation.
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	type Fun is function(int) -> int
	
	function map(int[] items, Fun fn) -> int[]
	requires |items| > 0 
	requires all { i in 0..|items| | items[i] > 0}:
	    int i = 0
	    while i < |items|
	    where 0 <= i && i <= |items|:
	        items[i] = fn(items[i])
	        i = i + 1
		return items
	\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}


\section{June 18th 2018}
\subsection{Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Pearce
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Action points were achieved since the last meeting}
 Created function optimisation for un-recursive functions by random generation.
\subsection{Action points have yet to be achieved since the last meeting}
None.
\subsection{Action points were agreed to for the next meeting}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Start preliminary work with the experiments. Record statistics when running tests, and compare function call optimisation and caching against Whiley test suite.
	\item Run Whiley tests to see if there are invalid tests. Also run WyBench tests from the develop branch.
	\item Add flags for different parameters like whether to enable and disable function optimisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion Points}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Encountered several problems when trying to implement function optimisation
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item For the Interpreter, I had to copy a lot of methods into my own version of the Interpreter due to the private scope.
 	Ideally, the methods would have the protected scope so I would only need to override the methods I require.
 	Dave says this should be okay.
 	\item Recursive functions are a problem! Especially when the invariants call a recursive function as this causes a StackOverflow due to an infinite loop. Currently, this has been disabled if the function is calling itself (e.g. factorial function).
 	Not too sure how to solve this as I need to be able to detect the difference between a normal function call and recursive function call. 
 	E.g. if there are two functions foo() and bar() where foo calls bar and bar calls foo until some condition is met.
 	Should try and disable this.
% 	Could possibly keep track of the different scopes, if the functions called within a scope are the same then just execute the function normally?
