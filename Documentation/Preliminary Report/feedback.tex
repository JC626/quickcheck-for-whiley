\section{Request for Feedback}\label{section:feedback}

%This should highlight any difficulties currently faced, and
%make specific requests for guidance from the examination committee. For example, a student may be unsure how best to evaluate their artifact, and would appreciate
%suggestions for alternative methods.

Feedback about using the Whiley Compiler test suite for evaluating the tool as discussed in the Future Plan section and Subsection \ref{subsec:toolEval} would be appreciated. 

When evaluating the tool, I would like to know if the following method would be suitable. A method of evaluation could be executing the tool multiple times on the same test suite using different test techniques such as random and exhaustive test case generation. 
The results can then be compared based on speed of execution, number of tests passed and number of errors detected. 
Alternative suggestions on how to evaluate the tool would be helpful.
