\chapter{Future Plan}\label{chapter:future}

%This should highlight the main components which remain to be done, and provide a proposed time-line in which this will happen. In putting together a time line, students must take into account upcoming examinations, coursework deadlines
%and other disruptions.

A working implementation has been completed halfway through the project. However, there are still several components that need to be completed.
A timeline of these components is shown in Table \ref{table:timeline}
