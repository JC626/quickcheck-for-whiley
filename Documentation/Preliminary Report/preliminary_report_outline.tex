% Current options are:

%                         (msor option retained for reproducing old data)
% [bschonscomp|mcompsci]  Which degree you are doing
%                          You can also specify any other degree by name
%                          (see below)
% [font|image]            Use a font or an image for the VUW logo

\begin{abstract}
%A short description of the project goes here.
This report is about the progress accomplished in the project: QuickCheck for Whiley. 
The project aims to improve software quality of Whiley programs by implementing automated test-case generation. 
The Whiley language and the automatic test-case generation tools: QuickCheck, Concholic Unit Testing Engine and Randoop are investigated.
QuickCheck for Whiley has been implemented for random and exhaustive test-case generation with different data types generated and integer range analysis applied using constraints.
A timeline is created for completing the implementation of function/method call optimisation, mutation testing and evaluation of the tool. 
Feedback for evaluating the tool is requested.
