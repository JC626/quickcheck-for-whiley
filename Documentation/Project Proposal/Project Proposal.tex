\begin{abstract}
   This document is a project proposal for the project, QuickCheck for Whiley. It describes an engineering problem and how this project will solve the problem. It will also explain how to evaluate my proposed solution and any resource requirements needed for this project.
%  This document gives some ideas about how to write a project
%  proposal, and provides a template for a proposal. You should discuss
%  your proposal with your supervisor.

\section*{1. Introduction}
Testing is an important process in software development as it helps detect the presence of bugs. However, writing and running tests can be tedious and costly. Furthermore, it is difficult to write tests for all possible cases therefore, obscure bugs may not be detected. An automated test-case generator called QuickCheck was implemented in Haskell to solve these issues. This tool creates a large number of tests using user-defined properties and geenrating random input values.

This project is about implementing an automated test-case generator for the programming language, Whiley based on the QuickCheck tool.

%In this section you should include a very brief introduction to the problem and the project.
%
%Your project proposal should cover the following points:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the engineering problem that you are going to solve;
%\item how you plan to solve your problem;
%\item how you intend to evaluate your solution; and
%\item any resource requirements for your project such as software,
%  hardware or other resources that will be needed in the course of the
%  project.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Your proposal should be not more than than 3 pages long.

\section*{2. The Problem}
Whiley is a programming language, developed to verify code and eliminate errors using formal specifications. 
Ideally, programs written in Whiley should contain as few errors. 
To achieve this goal, Whiley contains a verifying compiler which employs the use of specifications written by a developer to check for common errors such as accessing an index of an array which is outside its boundaries.

Currently, the verifying compiler has limitations when evaluating complex pre- and post-conditions. 
For example, a post-condition could be falsely identified as not holding by the verifying compiler even though the program does meet the post-condition.
Therefore, this project aims to implement an automated test-case generator in Whiley to improve software quality  and increase confidence in unverifiable code.

%In this section you should give a brief description of the problem
%itself. You want to briefly explain the problem, why it is important
%to solve the problem and define your project aims. After reading this
%section, the reader should understand why it is a problem, believe
%that it is important to solve and have a clear idea of the aims of
%your project.
%
%When describing the aims of the project, you should avoid vague,
%unmeasurable words like `analyse', `investigate', `describe', and use
%specific, measurable words like `implement', `demonstrate', `show',
%`prove'.
%
%For example:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[\bf Good] The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate a
%  management system for network switches;
%\end{itemize}
%is much better than:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[\bf Bad] The aim of this project is to investigate management
%  systems for network switches.
%\end{itemize}
%
%In the second case there is no idea of how much work is involved, and
%you will never know whether you have finished. You and your supervisor
%(and the markers of your project) may have very different ideas about
%what such an `investigation' involves. Of course, it is possible that
%the task you set yourself is not achievable, but if you are clear from
%the outset this is less likely, and will more easily be corrected.

\section*{3. Proposed Solution}

The automated test generator requires reading a Whiley program and creating tests from it.

%In this section you will explain how solve the problem, that is, how
%you intend to carry the project out. At this early stage you need to
%be both clear about what you are going to do and flexible enough to
%adapt to changing circumstances. Making an early plan will not prevent
%you from running into trouble, but it will help you identify possible
%problems early. For example, if you intended to run an experiment in
%HCI, you might realise early on that there would be problems gathering
%sufficient data to get reliable results, and that you should re-design
%your experiment.
%
%Part of the planning process involves producing a timetable for when
%the work is actually going to be done.
%
%Each part of the project should produce some output. For example you
%might plan on spending two weeks on background reading: the output of
%this will be a bibliography, and a possibly a literature survey for
%your report. Indeed, if you take the advice given above about having
%specific, measurable goals, you should describe this part of your
%project as:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[\bf Good] Produce bibliography (est: 2 weeks)
%\end{itemize}
%rather than
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[\bf Bad] Background reading (est: 2 weeks)
%\end{itemize}
%
%Note that the methodology you outline here is dependent upon the type
%of project and engineering area. You must talk to your supervisor
%about this.

\section*{4. Evaluating your Solution}

To evaluate this tool, we will insert bugs into a small benchmark set and see whether they can be uncovered by the tool.

%In this section you will explain how you will evaluate your solution
%once you have built it. The method of evaluation will be domain
%specific. Your supervisor should provide guidance as to what is an
%appropriate form of evaluation. For example, user testing for a HCI
%project or performance measurement for a Network Engineering project.

\section*{5. Resource Requirements}

No special resources are required. Only the use of the ECS laboratories is required.
